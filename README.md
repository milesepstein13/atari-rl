# atari-rl
Testing Various RL Methods on Atari Games

Built off of https://github.com/MushroomRL/mushroom-rl/blob/dev/examples/atari_dqn.py

Each algorithm can be run with ```python mushroomatari.py --algorithm [algorithm name] ```, or ```python mushroomatari.py --algorithm [algorithm name] --debug ``` for very short training time for debugging purposes

Options for algorithm names are ```['dqn', 'ddqn', 'adqn', 'mmdqn', 'cdqn', 'dueldqn', 'ndqn', 'qdqn', 'rainbow', 'sarsa']```

Running with no algorithm specified uses DQN.

I added and am debugging the sarsa option, which uses Using SARSALambdaContinuous. It is continuous, but lots of other RL algorithms (e.g. standard Q learning) are discrete, but there may be additional options to add here https://mushroomrl.readthedocs.io/en/dev/_modules/index.html

New Algorithms can be added by adding it to imports at line 12, adding its argument name at line 156, and
